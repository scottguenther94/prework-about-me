      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hey y'all! My name is Scotty, and I'm about to be the next 
        best web developer in these great United Sates</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Atlanta, GA</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>In my downtime, I enjoy making music. I'm very fascinated with audio
        production and sound design, and I love songwriting
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is to star in a comedic sitcom</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Logan Square with my wife and two cats</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>For most of my life, I actually wanted to be a church pastor. When
        I decided that wasn't for me, I had to go back to the drawing board. 
        I have friends who are in UX/UI design, and they were really encouraging me
        to look into tech. After doing just a little bit of research, I found that web
        development is an ideal career for me. I've always loved anything creative, 
        challenging (in a problem solving sort of way), and tech. After doing a few free
        courses, I knew I'd be happy going all-in.
